# 📝 Session Summary - 2025-11-14

**Session Type**: Major Planning & Decision
**Duration**: Extended session
**Outcome**: V5 plan finalized, ready to execute

---

## 🎯 Major Decisions Made

### 1. **Root Cause Identified**
```
Problem: V4 models stuck at 50% accuracy
Root Cause: Free Coinbase data too noisy (not architecture)
User's Insight: "Data is our blood" - absolutely correct
```

### 2. **V5 Strategy Decided**
```
Approach: UPGRADE data source (not rebuild)
What changes: 10% (data + features)
What stays: 90% (all architecture)
Timeline: 2-3 weeks (not 8 weeks)
```

### 3. **Budget Plan Approved**
```
Phase 1: <$200/month (validation)
Phase 2: $500/month (live trading)
Approach: Prove first, then scale
```

### 4. **Data Provider Selected**
```
Phase 1: Tardis.dev Historical ($147/month)
Real-time: Coinbase API (free, already have)
Total: $197/month ✅ Under $200
```
